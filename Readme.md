## 🤔 Why IntelliAgent?

<p>
  Traditional AI agents often rely on static algorithms or predefined rules,
  making them limited in adapting to real-world complexity. IntelliAgent overcomes
  this limitation by incorporating an adaptive learning model that evolves with
  new inputs. Whether it's a business application, a personal assistant, or a
  complex problem-solving tool, IntelliAgent learns from each interaction and
  continuously optimizes its decision-making process.
</p>
<p>
  By making use of dynamic, real-time data and personalized experiences,
  IntelliAgent can effectively respond to a wide range of use cases. It doesn't
  just perform tasks—it learns, adapts, and evolves, making it an indispensable
  tool in various domains.
</p>

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install IntelliAgent:

```bash
pip install intelliagent
```

2. Use it in your project:

```python
from intelliagent import DecisionMaker

# Set up the agent with a context and learning model
agent = DecisionMaker(api_key="provider-api-key",
                      model="gpt-4",
                      domain="financial advisor",
                      continuous_learning=True)
```

3. Provide real-time data and get dynamic decisions:

```python
user_id = "user456"
situation = "The stock market has shown a significant drop today."

# Get decision recommendation based on current context
decision = agent.make_decision(user_id=user_id, input_data=situation)
print(decision)  # Output: "It is advisable to diversify your investments to reduce risk."
```

## 🧩 Adaptive Learning

<p>IntelliAgent doesn't just make decisions based on pre-programmed rules—it learns from each interaction. Over time, it evolves its decision-making process, taking into account user-specific patterns and preferences.</p>

### Dynamic Learning Cycle:

1. **Data Input**: The agent receives real-time, context-rich input (e.g., user actions, environmental data).
2. **Context Analysis**: The agent analyzes the input and evaluates it against its existing knowledge base.
3. **Decision Generation**: Based on the analysis, the agent generates a decision, recommendation, or action.
4. **Feedback Loop**: The agent receives feedback on the decision and incorporates it into its learning model, continuously refining its approach.

## 🛠️ API Reference

### DecisionMaker

- `make_decision(user_id: str, input_data: str) -> JSON`: Make a decision based on user data and context
- `update_model(user_id: str, feedback: str) -> JSON`: Update the decision model with user feedback
- `get_decision_context(user_id: str) -> str`: Retrieve the decision-making context for a user
- `batch_process(user_id: str, inputs: List[str]) -> JSON`: Process multiple pieces of input data at once

### Continuous Learning

<p>IntelliAgent evolves its decision-making model by learning from feedback provided after each decision. This feedback can be positive or negative, influencing the agent's learning process for better future decisions.</p>

```python
feedback = "The investment suggestion was great, I made a 10% profit."
agent.update_model(user_id="user456", feedback=feedback)
```

### Sync vs Async Updates

- **Asynchronous Updates (`AsyncDecisionMaker`)**: Perfect for high-performance applications or those that require real-time responsiveness. This method processes input and updates in a non-blocking fashion, enhancing overall performance.
- **Synchronous Updates (`DecisionMaker`)**: Ideal for applications that require immediate decision generation and feedback handling in a sequential order.
